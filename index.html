    <h1>Chemistry Assignment</h1>
    <p>Chemistry is the branch of Science that deals with the properties, comosition, and behaviour of matter. It is fascinating field that explore the building blocks of the universe.</p>
    <h2>Chemical Elements</h2>

    <p>The <dfn>periodic table</dfn> is a tabular arrangement of chemical elements. Each element is represented by its
        chemical symbol, such as <var>Fe</var> for iron, <var>H</var> for hydrogen, and <var>O</var> for oxygen.
        Elements are classified into groups and periods based on their properties.</p>
    
    <h3>Chemical Equations</h3>

    <p>Chemical reaction are represned using chemical equations. Here's an example of a chemical reaction:</p>
    <p>2H<sub>2</sub> + O <sub>2</sub> -- > 2H <sub>2</sub>O</p>
    <p>This equation represnets the reaction between hydrogen gas (H<sub>2</sub>) and (O<sub>2</sub>).</p>

    <h4>Important Concepts</h4>



    
    <p><i>Stoichiometry</i> includes the number of atoms of each element in a moleculse,while <sup>superScripts</sup> represent charges or the number of atom in an ion</p>
